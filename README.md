Here is where I upload all my midis from my musescore or other.

My musescore page: https://musescore.com/user/39695313

My youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@papergamesproductions/

My YouTube playlist of score videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kigcne54Jbw&list=PLetRR5EIlniaMURMx5sZDSiu7cGTB_Itr


If there is a score that is outdated, corrupted, or missing, let me know and I will fix it. I don't update this very often but can update it quickly upon request.

The best way to reach me is via my Discord: https://discord.com/invite/UD3AWpW5mY


(note that some songs, for example the vocaloid ones, are not easy to export as midis. For those, see: https://github.com/Werdco57632/SynthV)
